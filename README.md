# Higher or Lower (C++)

A simple text-based 'Higher or Lower' program written in C++ as a way for me to learn the basics of the language.

## Build from source

### Requirements

Uh the g++ compiler I think?

Kinda still new to the whole C++ thing.

### Building

Clone the repo, then run the makefile.

The built file will be in a newly created build directory.
