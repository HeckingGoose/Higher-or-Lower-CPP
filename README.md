# Higher or Lower (C++)

A simple text-based 'Higher or Lower' program written in C++ as a way for me to learn the basics of the language.

## Build from source

### Requirements

CMake

### Building

Create a build directory.

Open a cli in the build directory.

Setup CMake using:
```
cmake ../
```

Move cli to source directory and build using:
```
cmake --build [build_directory_name]
```

This is my first C++ project and my first time working with CMake, so apologies in advance.
